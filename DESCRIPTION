Description: This package provides visualization of the results from
        the multiple (i.e. pairwise) comparison tests such as
        pairwise.t.test, pairwise.prop.test or pairwise.wilcox.test.
        The groups being compared are visualized as nodes in Hasse
        diagram. Such approach enables very clear and vivid depiction
        of which group is significantly greater than which others,
        especially if comparing a large number of groups.
